 * ctio.js:
 *
 * A simple way to read and write simple ctypes. Of course, as you'll find the
 * code isn't as simple as it might appear. The following types are currently
 * supported in big and little endian formats:
 *
 * 	uint8_t			int8_t
 * 	uint16_t		int16_t
 * 	uint32_t		int32_t
 *	float (single precision IEEE 754)
 *	double (double precision IEEE 754)
 *
 * This is designed to work in Node and v8. It may in fact work in other
 * Javascript interpreters (that'd be pretty neat), but it hasn't been tested.
 * If you find that it does in fact work, that's pretty cool. Try and pass word
 * back to the original author.
 *
 * Note to the reader: If you're tabstop isn't set to 8, parts of this may look
 * weird.

/*
 * Numbers in Javascript have a secret: all numbers must be represented with an
 * IEEE-754 double. The double has a mantissa with a length of 52 bits with an
 * implicit one. Thus the range of integers that can be represented is limited
 * to the size of the mantissa, this makes reading and writing 64-bit integers
 * difficult, but far from impossible.
 *
 * Another side effect of this representation is what happens when you use the
 * bitwise operators, i.e. shift left, shift right, and, or, etc. In Javascript,
 * each operand and the result is cast to a signed 32-bit number. However, in
 * the case of >>> the values are cast to an unsigned number.

/*
 * A reminder on endian related issues:
 *
 * Big Endian: MSB -> First byte
 * Little Endian: MSB->Last byte
