# through2

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/through2.png?downloads&downloadRank)](https://nodei.co/npm/through2/)

**A tiny wrapper around Node streams.Transform (Streams2) to avoid explicit subclassing noise**

Inspired by [Dominic Tarr](https://github.com/dominictarr)'s [through](https://github.com/dominictarr/through) in that it's so much easier to make a stream out of a function than it is to set up the prototype chain properly: `through(function (chunk) { ... })`.

Note: A **Streams3** version of through2 is available in npm with the tag `"1.0"` rather than `"latest"` so an `npm install through2` will get you the current Streams2 version (version number is 0.x.x). To use a Streams3 version use `npm install through2@1` to fetch the latest version 1.x.x. More information about Streams2 vs Streams3 and recommendations see the article **[Why I don't use Node's core 'stream' module](http://r.va.gg/2014/06/why-i-dont-use-nodes-core-stream-module.html)**.
