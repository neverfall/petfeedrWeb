yet another unzip library for node. For zipping, see
[yazl](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yazl).

Design principles:

 * Follow the spec.
   Don't scan for local file headers.
   Read the central directory for file metadata.
   (see [No Streaming Unzip API](#no-streaming-unzip-api)).
 * Don't block the JavaScript thread.
   Use and provide async APIs.
 * Keep memory usage under control.
   Don't attempt to buffer entire files in RAM at once.
 * Never crash (if used properly).
   Don't let malformed zip files bring down client applications who are trying to catch errors.
 * Catch unsafe filenames entries.
   A zip file entry throws an error if its file name starts with `"/"` or `/[A-Za-z]:\//`
   or if it contains `".."` path segments or `"\\"` (per the spec).
