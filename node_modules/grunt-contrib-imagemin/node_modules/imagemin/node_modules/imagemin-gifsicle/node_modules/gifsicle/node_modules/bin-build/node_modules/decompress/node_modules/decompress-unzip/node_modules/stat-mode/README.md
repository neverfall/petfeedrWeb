### Offers convenient getters and setters for the stat `mode`

into that number.

The specific information includes:

 * What the ["file type"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types) of file it is
 * Whether or not the [`setuid` and `setgid` bits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid) are set
 * Whether or not the [`sticky` bit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit) is set
 * The [_read_, _write_, and _execute_ permissions for the _owner_, _group_ and _others_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions)

own `fs.Stat` object for
